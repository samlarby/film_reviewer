# Film Fanatic
## Introduction
The purpose of this website is for people to see other peoples reviews of films. But also for users to be able to add their own reviews to films. The site is aimed at people who often watch films and want to find films to watch and see what others have said about them. If there is a new film not on the website users will be able to add it.

## User Experience

### First time visitors
* As a first time visitor I want to see the films.
* I want to be able to see what people have said about certain films.
* I want to be able to create my own account so I can review films in the future.

### Second time visitors
* As a second time visitor I want to be able to log into my account.
* I want to be able to review a film I have watched.
* If the film I watched isn't on the website I want to be able to add it. 



### Design Choices
* Colour Scheme
    * The two main colours used on this website are #e98b72 which is an orange colour and #eed195 which is a yellow colour. These colours were chosen to add a fun and proffessional look on top of a dark background. 
    
* Typography
    * The font used was Roboto, with sans-serif set as a back up font. Roboto was used as it has an easy readibility and has a clean and modern design.
* Imagery
    * The background image used was taken from unsplash, linked below in the acknowledgements section.

## Bugs Found
* A bug found whilst working on the website is that when trying to delete a review on a film it would delete the film as well. To overcome this I imported UUID to be able to generate unique id's for each review so they could be deleted that way. I used stack overflow to help me understand this.
